## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process
1 - I started by appling the default styles to border such as no margin, no padding, border-box, background color and font-family.
2 - Started working with the card container which has all the information, positioning everything inside and it self and adding border, border-radius and box-shadow.
3 - Applied width, margin-top and border-radius to the img.
4 - Worked with the Hs elements and Paragraph in the card applying font-size, font-weight, color and margin.
5 - Positioned author section with flex-box and decreased the image size.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this challange I learned how to use the box-shadow property

```css
.box-shadow-property {
  box-shadow: 5px 5px var(--black-color);
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Box-Shadow](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow) - This helped me learn how to use box-shadow property.
